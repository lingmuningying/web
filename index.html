										<p>People who work overtime are considered to be those who cannot produce results within the allotted time, and vacations are taken company-wide. Many restaurants offer "Happy Hour", a service that allows people to eat and drink at a discount starting from dinner time, and it is a common sight for businessmen to have a drink after work. The law allows for five weeks of paid vacation, so you can take a month off in the summer.

										<h3>SPAIN</h3>
										<p>There is a style of working until past noon, taking a siesta break for about three hours, and then working again in the cooler evening hours.

										<h3>US</h3>
										<p>Another characteristic of the U.S. is that there is no legal obligation to grant paid work. Secondly, the American employment system is characterized by job-based employment, discretionary labor, and performance-based employment. In Japan, full-time employees are members of a company and can be transferred to any department or location within the company, but in the U.S., white-collar employees are generally hired for a specific job, position, or location.
