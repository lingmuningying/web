								<h2></h2>
								<p>China is one of the world's oldest civilizations: it has the oldest continuous civilization near Yellow River region. There is archaeological evidence over 5,000 years old. China also has one of the world's oldest writing systems (and the oldest in use today). China has been the source of many major inventions. Geographically, China’s longest river is the Yangtze River which runs through mega cities and is home to many species. It is the world’s third longest river.</p>
								<h2>national polity</h2>
								<p>The political system has been a de facto one-party dictatorship of the Chinese Communist Party since its founding in October 1949. The Economist Intelligence Unit, a research institute affiliated with The Economist magazine, ranks China 153rd in the world in its Democracy Index, classifying it as a dictatorship (2019). It is also ranked fourth from the bottom in the world's press freedom rankings by Reporters Without Borders, at 177th place, making it one of the most seriously affected countries.</p>
								<h2>diplomacy</h2>
								<p>China today is a member of a number of formal and informal multilateral organizations, including the WTO, APEC, BRICs, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BCIM, and G20. China is a regional power in Asia and has been characterized by many commentators as a potential superpower. However, since Xi Jinping came to power, China has taken a more belligerent and hard-line diplomatic stance, known as "war-wolf diplomacy," and friction with the international community has become more noticeable. In addition, international criticism over human rights issues such as Hong Kong and the Uyghur issue is increasing.
